# **App Name**: WhatsAnalyzer

## Core Features:

- Chat Upload: Upload a compressed WhatsApp chat file to the app.
- Chat Display: Display the chat content in a WhatsApp-like interface on the left side of the screen.
- Chat Analysis: Analyze the entire chat history once uploaded and prepare it as a tool to be queried by the LLM.
- Query Interface: Provide a chat-like interface (similar to ChatGPT) for users to ask questions about the chat content, like the number of bike accident mentions.
- Chat Summary: Summarize key points from the chat or analyze the main discussion topics within a specific time frame when the user asks for a summary or main topics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #4CAF50 (Green) to mirror WhatsApp's brand identity, suggesting communication and clarity.
- Background color: #F0F2F5, a very light, desaturated tint of the primary color (green) to provide a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the chat content. This follows a light color scheme.
- Accent color: #2196F3 (Blue) for interactive elements like buttons and links, creating a clear visual separation and signaling interactivity.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both headings and body text to maintain readability and a modern, clean look throughout the application.
- Use minimalistic icons that reflect actions (upload, summarize) for easy user understanding.
- A split-screen layout with the chat display on the left and the query interface on the right, similar to messaging apps.
- Use subtle animations for loading and query responses to enhance user experience without being intrusive.
